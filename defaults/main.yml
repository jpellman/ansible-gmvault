# defaults file for ansible-gmvault

# The variables below are used to define
# default arguments for when cron jobs
# that invoke gmvault are run.  They are
# ignored if no cron jobs are defined.
# They can be overridden by defining
# a corresponding variable in one of the 
# named crons in gmvault_cron_list below. 
gmvault_cron_default_minute: "0"
gmvault_cron_default_hour: "4"
gmvault_cron_default_day: "*"
gmvault_cron_default_month: "*"
gmvault_cron_default_weekday: "*" 

# gmvault_cron_list should be populated with a list of 
# dictionaries.  Each dictionary in the list should
# contain values indicating which flags should be
# passed to gmvault for a cron job or cron jobs
# that invoke gmvault automatically.
# For flags that accept arguments the value should be
# the corresponding argument.  For flags that represent
# booleans, "True" should be added to indicate that the 
# flag should be appended to the gmvault command.
# Omitting a flag from the list will have the
# same result as setting that boolean flag to "False",
# which is to omit that flag entirely from the command syntax.
#
# If gmvault_cron_list is undefined, no crons will be
# added and gmvault will just be installed.
#
# Note that as of 3/31/19, you'll have to implement
# one of the workarounds indicated in the links below:

#
# If you opt to use an app password, the Ansible playbook will run
# "gmvault sync --store-passwd <email>" before creating the crons
# to store your credentials.  This behavior can be overridden
# by defining a variable gmvault_store_passwd and setting it to "False".
